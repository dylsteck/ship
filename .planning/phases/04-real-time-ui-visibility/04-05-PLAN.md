<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance session-list styling to match Ramp design</name>
  <files>apps/web/components/session/session-list.tsx</files>
  <action>
Enhance session-list.tsx styling to match Ramp Inspect design patterns.

Design improvements:
- Clean card-based layout for each session
- Subtle shadows and borders
- Better spacing between sessions (gap-4)
- Improved typography (session title, metadata)
- Hover states on session cards
- Clear action buttons (resume, delete) with proper styling
- Status indicators (if session has status)
- Timestamp formatting (relative time: "2 hours ago")
- Empty state when no sessions

Preserve existing functionality (onDelete, navigation). Focus on visual polish and spacing.

Reference RESEARCH.md Pattern 5 for design elements. Use Tailwind classes for styling.
