<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Enhance message-list styling to match Ramp design</name>
  <files>apps/web/components/chat/message-list.tsx</files>
  <action>
Enhance message-list.tsx styling to match Ramp Inspect design patterns.

Design improvements:
- Clean message bubbles with subtle shadows (shadow-sm or shadow-md)
- Better spacing between messages (gap-4 or gap-6)
- Improved typography (font sizes, line heights)
- User messages: Right-aligned, distinct background color
- Assistant messages: Left-aligned, different background
- System messages: Centered, muted styling
- Smooth scrolling behavior
- Loading state indicators (skeleton or spinner)

Preserve existing functionality (onLoadEarlier, onRetryError, etc.). Focus on visual polish and spacing.

Reference RESEARCH.md Pattern 5 for design elements. Use Tailwind classes for styling.

- Submit button styling (primary color, hover states)
- Queue count display (if queueCount > 0, show badge)
- Stop button styling (when isStreaming)
- Disabled state styling
- Focus states and transitions
- Better placeholder text

Preserve existing functionality (onSend, onStop, isStreaming, queueCount). Focus on visual polish and interaction feedback.

Reference existing chat-input.tsx and RESEARCH.md Pattern 5. Use Tailwind classes.

Layout improvements:
- Better container spacing and padding
- Connection status indicator styling (subtle, non-intrusive)
- Overall background and color scheme
