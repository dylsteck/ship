| 100-01 | Added backwards compatibility for old ID             | Prevents breaking existing sessions |
| 100-03 | Used Radix UI primitives for new components          | Consistency with existing base-ui   |

| 100-03 | ActivityFeed groups tools by status                  | Running first for visibility        |
